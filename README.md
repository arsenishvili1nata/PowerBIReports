# 🎓 Student Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

> 📊 An interactive analytics dashboard built in Power BI to explore the key factors influencing student exam performance.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes a dataset of student performance factors to understand what influences exam scores. The goal is to provide educators, researchers, or analysts with a tool to identify performance trends, behavioral impacts, and areas for targeted academic support.

---

## 🔎 Dataset

The dashboard is based on the file:  
📁 `StudentPerformanceFactors.csv`  
It includes features such as:
- Exam scores
- Study hours
- Tutoring sessions
- Motivation level
- Parental involvement
- Sleep habits
- Peer influence
- Internet access and more

---

## 📊 Dashboard Structure

The report is divided into **three pages**, each targeting a different level of insight:

### 🔹 1. Main Page – Executive Summary
- 📈 KPI Cards: Avg Exam Score, % High Performers, % At Risk, Avg Study Hours
- 📊 Histogram: Exam Score distribution
- 📘 Breakdown by Gender and Motivation Level
- 📋 Dynamic table with conditional formatting and slicers
-![Main Page](screenshots/OverView.png)


### 🔹 2. Influencing Factors (Behavioral + Support)
- 🧠 Scatter plot: Study Hours vs. Exam Score
- 📊 Column chart: Average scores by support categories (Parental Involvement, Resources, Tutoring)
- 🔥 Matrix heatmap: Sleep Hours vs. Tutoring Sessions
- 📉 Combo chart: Peer Influence and Physical Activity
- 🎛️ Slicers: Gender, School Type, Motivation, Internet Access, etc.
-![Factors Page](screenshots/Influencing Factors.png)

### 🔹 3. (Coming Soon) Segmentation & What-If Simulation
- Student clustering by behavior and support
- Predictive analysis based on study/tutoring input
- What-if scenario tool to estimate performance changes

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Students with high motivation and access to tutoring consistently score above average.
- Sleep deprivation combined with intense study hours shows diminishing returns.
- Parental involvement and internet access strongly correlate with performance in lower-income students.
- Clear at-risk groups can be identified based on behavioral patterns and low support.
